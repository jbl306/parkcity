Hello everybody and welcome to Insiders
Guide. Today we're discussing Veil's
Marquee Utah Mountain Park City. Due to
the insane extent of the ski area, this
episode is split into four parts with
the first two discussing the mountain
village side of the resort. In this
part, we're continuing the discussion by
investigating the canyons village area
of the mountain. So with all that out of
the way, let's continue in Insiders
Guide to Ski Resorts Park City.
Now, we covered a lot of background
information about the resort and region
as a whole in part A, so we'll keep this
background section brief and specific
only to Canyons. The Canyons Village is
home to dozens of highquality lodging,
dining, and shopping options,
effectively serving as its own town.
However, even if you're staying in
Canyons Village, I would still highly
recommend heading into the town of Park
City at least once just to experience
it. Canyons itself as a ski area has
some more concentrated areas and some
more spread out areas. Due to how it is
built around a residential area,
navigating to and from certain pods can
be a little bit difficult despite
signage on mountain being quite good.
There are many flat spots and choke
points you could accidentally get stuck
in and Canyon sees its fair share of
lift lines as well. Throughout this and
the next part of this episode, we're
going to be discussing all of that and
more so that you can make the most out
of your time on the hill. Something
important to note, as mentioned in part
A, Park City as a whole is not the
greatest for beginners. This principle
especially applies to canyons. So if you
are a beginner, you're going to want to
look at the mountain village side.
Now, if you're not staying in Canyons
Village and are driving in, for the time
being, the parking experience is pretty
convoluted. Currently, they're working
on building a five-level parking
structure adjacent to the Cabriolet.
From what I understand, when fully
complete, the top two levels will be day
parking and the bottom will be a transit
plaza, which would leave the middle two
for vehicles of lodging guests and
employees. I would have to assume they
haven't officially announced anything on
whether it will be free or not, but I
would say that given the route that
other ski resorts have gone recently,
it's a fair bet that parking in the new
parking garage will be paid only and
require reservations on peak days.
Unfortunately, that means that the days
of free parking at canyons have pretty
much gone by the wayside. For the time
being, there are some paid lots further
in the village, but when the structure
is complete, those parking lots are
supposed to be turned into land plots
for developers to purchase. This leaves
the far and away best option. Taking
transit, the High Valley Transit Agency
runs a very consistent free bus network
that can get you between Canyons Village
and several parking rides, the town of
Park City, and the mountain village base
area. No shade to the town of Park
City's transit, but I've found that the
High Valley buses run much more
consistently on time. As I recommended
in part A, downloading the transit app
is very useful as you can type in your
destination and it'll give you real-time
bus tracking and step-by-step directions
to get there.
Now, this whole parking structure, where
you'll end up, whether you drive or take
the bus, drops you off at the Cabriolet.
The Cabriolet is a pretty unique and
rare lift, as it is effectively an open
air gondola cabin that you stand in.
This is something we'll go more into in
a video in May. But the Cabriolet
actually turns using caned shifts, which
is another piece that adds to its
uniqueness because it is the link
between this huge hub and the actual
skiing lifts. The Cabriolet can get
decent buildup on peak days. Bear with
it and you'll end up in the village
before you know it. Cabriolet lines are
often the fastest moving of any lift in
Park City.
Now, once you make it into the village,
you have three lift options. If you're
coming from the Cabriolet area, directly
in front of you will be the Red Pine
Gondola. If you walk just a minute or
two to the other end of the beach,
you'll have access to the Orange Bubble
Express. If you're coming from the
southern end of the village here by the
Pendry Hotel, you'll have access to the
Sunrise Gondola. It's not really
practical to head to Sunrise from the
Cabriolet area and vice versa. This
trail map is from the 2425 season, so it
doesn't yet have the Sunrise Gondola on
it, but the gondola goes from the bottom
of the old double chair here and runs up
to the Red Pine Lodge, finishing right
next to the Red Pine Gondola. For
clarity, the gondola is replacing this
double a few months after the recording
of this video. So, the lift you see on
this map no longer exists. Because the
sunrise gondola is tucked away in this
different part of the village, it most
likely won't see as long of lines as the
other two lifts. Because it doesn't
exist at the time of writing this video,
we can't say exactly, but we predict
that on peak days, the gondola will get
around 15-minute lines peaking around
midm morning. As is the case with all
three base area lifts, past about 11:30,
they really empty out. Over on the
Cabriolet side, Orange Bubbles lines
tend to move quite a bit faster than the
gondilas, and his location at the end of
the village makes it less popular, so it
is by far a better choice on peak days.
The word bubble in the name refers to
these protective coverings you can pull
down to protect yourself from the
elements on stormy days. Thus, there's
no need to head to a gondola for
shelter, as you can get shelter on this
particular chairlift as well. Lift lines
at Orange Bubble tend to be about 5
minutes shorter than Red Pines and will
probably be about 5 minutes longer than
Sunrises.
To return to the base area at the end of
the day, you have a handful of options.
The first is to download either of the
two gondilas depending on what part of
the village you want to land at. If
you're a beginner or low intermediate, I
would highly, highly recommend doing
this. There's no shame in writing a
gondola down. Another option is to ski
all the way down this looker's right
side via willow Draw. Willow Draw is
pretty flat, and while it's not the
worst thing in the world, I much prefer
riding down the gondola. Halfway down
Willow Draw, you have to take a ropetoe,
which just compounds the annoyance. If
you're up on a weekend or holiday,
another option available will be to take
the shortcut triple and ski down from
there. We'll discuss all of these runs
shortly. On weekdays, the shortcut
triple does not operate. To access
shortcut, you'll need to be on the
skier's left side of the lodge building
and ski down under the Red Pine Gondola
just a bit. The final option, and what I
recommend if you want to ski instead of
riding a gondola, is to make your way to
the bottom of Tombstone and ride Over
and Out. We'll discuss the Tombstone
terrain in part D. Over and Out and
Shortcut are both pretty scenic lifts,
bringing you up and down through the
namesake canyons. From the top of Over
and Out, you'll have to take the super
crowded Raptor Way trail for a little
while, but it then quickly opens up to
Retreat, Sunrise, and finally filters
onto Doc's Run, all of which are much
wider, nicer cruisers. As is with most
ski resort based areas, the low
elevation and high usage of these runs
can lead to them becoming quite icy, so
do be cautious.
The Orange Bubble Express, referred to
as OBX for short, has a midstation at
which you have the option to unload. If
you unload at the OBX midstation or come
off of shortcut, you'll have a pretty
diverse set of terrain options. The
primary run here is Doc's Run, which is
a fantastic blue cruiser, except for
this section here where it is
legitimately uphill. While heading down
the drain may seem like a decent
alternative as it goes down the face
instead of around, it quickly develops
into an equally uphill road. So, it's
really a pick your poison scenario. From
this area, you have access to links and
eagle along with some decent tree
skiing. This whole side stays well
shaded and has much better snow than the
runs on the opposing face. Those being
Silverado and Silverado Bull. Silverado
specifically is more of a mogul goalie,
so it does fill in nicely, but it gets
quite sunbaked. Silverado Bull gets
absolutely blasted by the sun and thus
tends to have some issues with coverage.
On the opposite side of the bull from
Doc's run is Lookout Ridge, and I would
much sooner recommend this run than
Docks. Lookout Ridge is one of my
personal favorite groomers in all of
Park City. While it is low altitude, it
has a pretty consistent fall line, is
plenty long, and is normally devoid of
other skiers. It dumps you onto Willow
Draw, but is easy enough to conserve
enough speed to get back to OBX without
having to push or skate. All the way at
the bottom of Doc's run here, sixes and
Outlaw are good places to get some
mellow bump laps. Although beware, the
conditions down here aren't always the
best for off-piece.
Up at that same summit is the Lookout
Cabin restaurant, which is a full
service restaurant that has, among many
other things, fondue. If you're looking
to slow it down for a few hours, this is
a great place to go. But if you want a
quicker cafeteria style lunch, head to
either Red Pine Lodge or Sun Lodge. I
personally prefer Sun Lodge as it's a
bit out of the way, whereas Red Pine is
right at the center of all the action,
so it's a lot busier. Sun Lodge is
located above the bottom of the Sun Peak
Express, so to access it from Lookout
Cabin, you want either Boomer or Broken
Arrow. Boomer is basically a road the
whole way around, while Broken Arrow
cuts the corner. Grizzly is sometimes
grimmed, and when it is, it's a
fantastic steep cruiser. GeForce and
Super Fury aren't crazy long, but
they're real steep and feature big old
mogul. They're true leg burners and a
great way to warm up before heading up
to the steeps if that's the style of
skiing you like. Black Hole keeps pretty
good snow, but I found better tree
skiing elsewhere. You can't get to Sun
Peak from Black Hole or anything further
down, so keep that in mind. Badlands is
very similar to GeForce and Super Fury,
while Tower and Diablo are more sunposed
and as such tend to have worse snow
conditions. Arrowhead isn't groomed all
that often, but typically doesn't get
mogul. The lower half of Arrowhead turns
into a road, but it's not too flat.
Arrowhead via OBX and Lookout is the
fastest way to Condor, which is our next
discussion point.
The Super Condor Express Quad doesn't
have the biggest capacity in the world,
but it's tucked in this corner of the
resort and typically doesn't get too bad
of a buildup. Apex Ridge is a favorite
of ski school instructors at Park City,
and that's for a reason. As far as Blue
Cruisers go, Apex has got to be one of,
if not the single longest and
straightest you can find. It is a little
bit steep for a blue, but you can scope
it from the lift. And if it looks too
difficult, you can take the
significantly milder boa. Just beware
that lower boa can get pretty flat and
slow in spots. And there are lots of
highle skiers flowing down from these
blacks all throughout it. Along this
northern side of the ridge, you start
with Condor Woods, which is a pretty
standard, albeit steep glade area.
Beware that this flows into Kanes Lupus,
which is the longest natural goalie at
Park City. It's quite steep and gets
narrow in some spots, and on hard pack
days, it can feel a little bit hard to
control yourself. Once you enter Kynes,
you're pretty committed as there's only
one emergency exit about halfway down.
On softer days, however, it's loads of
fun and a run I would absolutely
recommend.
Down below that area, you have Appland
and Kestrel, which both get grooming
every couple days, and when either is
groomed, they're one of the best
cruisers in canyons. Wedged between them
is Devil's Friend, home to some of the
biggest mogul you'll find at Park City.
This is a super fun run. And if you're
looking for one of the most trying leg
burners, this is absolutely the place
for you. Down below, you've got
Thrasher, which is a much wider mogul
face, and Rendevu Ridge, which gets lots
of sun exposure. Between Apex and
Rendevous is a small bowl area with
bumps and small thickets of brush. Over
on the other side of the ridge are some
steeper, wilder mogul runs. Some of
these run down small ridges, some in
gullies, and some even offer a bit of
tree skiing. However, these runs phase
straight south, meaning they don't hold
snow well at all and are only truly good
on a few days of the season.
Crisscrossing through is the easy street
catwalk, which is one of the flattest
roads at canyons. That statement
includes all of its variations down
here. If you're looking to get to the
Sun Lodge or Sun Peak lift, however, you
will have to suffer through it. The only
other way to escape Super Condor is
through Willow Draw. Neither of these
exits are great, so if you're going to
lap Condor, hit it all in one chunk
rather than in several spurts. That way
you only have to deal with these exits
once. In the spring, moose love to
frequent the bushes in the lower
unskable part of this side of the ridge.
So keep an eye out on the ride up.
Off the top of the condor, you have the
option to take a 20 to 30 minute hike up
Murdoch Peak. This hike is grueling, but
the views you'll get at the top are
absolutely insane. The terrain, however,
isn't really. For the most part, you
just have this big open face with some
aspens throughout. There are a few
cliffs and whatnot if you get lucky or
search real hard, but in all honesty,
you don't do this hike for the terrain.
You do the hike for the views. As such,
it's a oneanddone deal for me.
Wedged between OBX and Condor is the Sun
Peak Express. Similarly to Condor, it
has a pretty low capacity, but doesn't
get too busy. This time, rather than due
to its location, it's because Sun Peak
doesn't really serve as a lapping lift
and is more of just a transit lift to
get between those two aforementioned
zones and the Red Pine Lodge area. As
far as the lapping runs go, Ekko and
Flume make a fantastic long blue
cruiser. However, this run gets quite
busy. Eclipse doesn't get groomed each
night, but gets it enough not to get
moguls. When it is groomed, it's a must
hit for all intermediates. Massacre is
straight as an arrow and fairly steep.
It and Mineshaft are a pair of good
mogul runs, although I'm not the biggest
fan of either because they require an
annoying run out to get back to Sun Peak
along the blue roads we discussed
earlier. The same can be said for these
trees. Good skiing, not worth the egress
pain. Off the top of the lift, if you
turn left, you'll be headed down
Eclipse. You can cut across along the
rgeline by the bottom of the park to
escape to Echo before Eclipse gets
steep. But beware, this cut across isn't
groomed. To get to Echko more easily,
take Upper Mainline. Upper Mainline can
be flattened spots, but it's far from
the worst. Transitions is the only
terrain park on the canyon side and is
quite a long trail with a large variety
of features throughout the duration of
it. Past Orange Bubble, you'll be
funneled onto Mainline, which is pretty
flat for a while before having one final
drop into the Red Pine Lodge area. This
area gets pretty busy, so ski with
caution.
Another option you have if mainline is
too busy for you is to enter the High
Meadow beginner area. However, if you're
going to do this, understand the area
you're going into and the people that
are going to be there and ski it
accordingly. Nobody likes someone flying
past beginners when there's a segregated
blue that goes to the same place. Now,
within the beginner area, Mellow Moose
is the main super wide area. There's
plenty of space here for everyone to
have their own lane, and it makes for a
truly fantastic learning experience. For
some variety, you can head into the
woods along Alleycat, which is a fun
little winding road. You can also take
the hidden bear cat track on the
opposite side, but beware that this is
where a lot of the blacks of the
saddleback pod will flow onto. Now, this
High Meadow area is the only place with
greens in all of canyons. And as such,
High Meadow can get some of the longest
lift lines in all of Park City. There's
not much you can do about it, but just
be prepared.
Right next to High Meadow is the
Saddleback Express Quad. Since it's
right in the center of everything, it
would make sense that it's consistently
busy. But Saddleback is actually
typically pretty quiet, at least when
compared to the base area lifts High
Meadow and Tombstone. The pod in general
mostly consists of some of the easiest
blues in all of Park City. Over on the
looker's right side, Painted Horse is
pretty flat, while Cocoapelli undulates
a little bit. Pine Draw has the best
snow of the three, but is also pretty
narrow compared to the other two. It has
a more consistent pitch than the other
two as well. On the looker's left side
is Snow Dancer, which is by far the
easiest blue you'll find at Park City.
When you're confident on greens and
ready to try a blue, this is where to
go. It does have a steeper pitch right
at the bottom, but this can be bypassed
by taking Badgers bypass into the High
Meadow Zone. I would only recommend
taking badges from this lower
intersection, however, as its upper
section gets quite crowded and is a
little steep. This flying salmon run is
supposedly an adventure run, but in my
opinion, it's just an avoid at all cost
run. It is genuinely uphill to get to,
and there's no reward for your effort,
just a flat road through the forest.
Over on the other side, you have a pair
of natural goalies in Tunnel of Fun and
Hurricane Alley. Both are pretty mellow
and are great places to take the kids.
Tunnel of Fun is much more popular, is
narrower, and is shorter. So, I much
prefer Hurricane Alley. Tunnel of Fun is
accessed on the skier's right of Pineaw,
while you can access Hurricane Alley by
dropping off the skier's left side of
Cocoapelli or the skiers right of
Painted Horse at any point. Before going
into a natural goalie, you should be
fully confident in making quick
decisions, stopping and turning on blue
slopes. All of these blues on the
Looker's right side of the pod dump you
onto Mainline with the option of heading
into the High Meadow area.
In between the blues are a series of
pretty serious blacks. This entire set
of runs from Ecstasy to Shadows appears
to be tree skiing on the map, but it's
more of a big mogul face with some short
patches of trees thrown in here and
there. This can all be accessed from Elk
Ridge, which is a mogul run that goes
down the ridge line until turning into a
small face that drops you onto Hidden
Bear. Silverhorse is another mogul run
going straight under the lift until it
meets Flying Salmon. You also have the
option after the first steep pitch to
turn right into a tree gully, which can
be pretty fun. Wedi is a pretty small
bowl, also typically bumped up, that
takes you from Elk Ridge down to Silver
Horse and Flying Salmon. The best single
black run in the whole pod is the
Aspens, which is exactly what it sounds
like. The aesthetic of cruising through
a forest of aspens, thin enough to ski
fast, but not too sparse not to feel
like tree skiing, just can't be beat.
All right, that about wraps it up for
part C of this insiders guide. We'll
pick up at the Red Pine Lodge in part D
and wrap up our discussion of Park City
from there. As always, please put any
questions down below. Thank you all for
watching. All my love. I'm out.
