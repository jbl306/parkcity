Hello everybody and welcome to Insiders
Guide. Today we're discussing the resort
at one of the most famous mountain towns
in the United States, Park City. Because
of the Goliath scale of the resort, this
episode is split into four parts with
part A providing crucial background
information and this part discussing the
bulk of the Park City side of the
mountain. So with that, let's continue
in Insiders Guide to Ski Resorts Park
City.
We'll start off over at the top of town
and payday. The bulk of this part will
be discussing intermediate and advanced
terrain in these lower pods. But if
you're here for the Jupiter Peak
extremes, jump to the time on screen to
skip all this. As discussed previously,
Bonanza access is quite flat, but also
quite short. To get to anywhere from
either of these lifts, you'll need to
ride the Bonanza lift. Bonanza service
is a small pod along with access from
the base area to the rest of the
mountain and as such it can get some
decent lines. However, they're not as
bad as one might think and pale in
comparison to some of the other lifts
we'll talk about. Within the Bonanza
Pod, you've got Home Run as the primary
green. It starts out as the primary
access to all this terrain on both sides
and as such gets extremely extremely
busy on its initial section. Ski with
extreme caution, control, and
anticipation in this area. Once other
runs start splitting off down here, it
gets significantly better. Home Run
itself switches back to the right,
becoming a bit narrower into just a road
as it descends down into the pod. It
then opens up at a big intersection with
lots of choices.
If you keep further left, you'll stay on
Home Run, which stays as a road and
gives you access to the base area. The
most popular option is to go right into
the big wide mellow goalie, which is the
Bonanza green that takes you directly to
the Bonanza lift. If you miss home run
but want to go to the base area, there
is another road on the left side you can
take that is shown here. If you miss
that, however, you'll be stuck riding
Bonanza. From this big intersection
above, you can also shoot across to
lower Jonesies. Jonesies itself is my
favorite run in the pod and it's a
fantastic cruiser, albeit just a touch
steep on its first pitch. At that big
intersection, you can continue all the
way across onto Short Line if you wish
to access Pioneer, although I don't
recommend this trail because it is ultra
flat. The same goes for Flat Iron, which
comes back from Pioneer. The one benefit
of Flat Iron is it allows base area
access from the Pioneer Pod. The Little
King's Park is mostly jumps and boxes
and is pretty short. It isn't as busy as
the three Kings Parks by the base area.
However, unshown on the trail map are a
pair of extremely short blue groomers
named Long Belly and Lilbelly that get
you from Lower Jonesies to Bonanza.
These allow you to cut across to the
road here that gets you back to the base
area. Below those two named trails are a
few unnamed and ungroomed roads that can
be some fun short off piece for
intermediates and up. These will not
give you access to the base area. If you
keep going past where home run switches
back and then take a right off the
ridge, you'll head down Bergsbowl, which
is a short, steep semi-treated area that
doesn't hold great snow. I don't
recommend it. Up where Jonesy's first
splits from home run, you can also go
right onto Mid Mountain Meadows. This
run is quite steep for a blue and can
get icy, but it's not terribly long. As
an alternative, you can take Mid
Mountain, which is a pretty tranquil
little road that winds through the
forest. These will take you down to the
Pioneer Lift, which we'll come back to
in a moment. There is some good lower
level tree skiing in and around Mid
Mountain. Just below Jonesies is
Belmont, which isn't often groomed, and
Muckers, which is another great blue
cruiser. Additionally, there is a
popular adventure run called Blaster.
This one is frequented by Ski School, so
there are other adventure runs elsewhere
I prefer more.
Now, as you head down home run, you'll
notice half, if not more, traffic
turning left instead of right, as if
going to Bonanza. This is all traffic
going to the Silver Load Lift. All of
it. There's also a lot of traffic going
to Silver Load from King Kong and the
Quicksilver Gondola, neither of which
you can see. All this is to say that
without a doubt, Silver sees by far the
worst crowds in the whole of Park City.
There are a multitude of reasons, so
let's start with this one. Claim Jumper.
Claim Jumper is pretty much the only
main mountain green in all of Park City
that isn't a road, doesn't switch back
or do anything like that. And as such,
it is exceptionally exceptionally
popular. Unless you're a true beginner,
avoid claim Jumper like the plague. If
you are a beginner, I would highly
recommend Bonanza as an alternative. If
you take Crescent out of the base area,
it's easiest to take one of these load
runs to claim Jumper to Silver Load to
get higher up. But I would recommend
taking this little cut here to home run
to Bonanza instead. Quarter load is the
widest while the others are just roads.
Additionally, from Silver Queen, you can
shoot across and get to Bonanza, even
though it doesn't look like it on the
map. So, this is another option.
There are lots of ways to avoid Silver
Load, but odds are that you'll end up at
it at some point during your visit
regardless because a lot of Silvero's
pod is just really good. Simple as that.
Something important to note is that the
top of Silver Load is set back and up a
little bit from these other two. So
access to Hidden Splender and Lost
Prospector from Bonanza or Motherload
takes some traversing and a lot of
willpower, so I recommend not trying it.
Hidden Splender down through assessment
here are good blue cruisers, although be
aware that not all of them are groomed
every night. Mel's Alley is a road and
isn't signed at a lot of the
intersections, so if you want to take it
the whole way, go left at all the
intersections. Lost Prospector, Newport,
and Dynamite are groomed often enough
not to be too mowgled. Shortfuse and
Detonator are both super fun adventure
runs, but I much prefer Detonator as
it's somewhat harder to get to,
requiring you to find and stick with
Mel's Alley. The adventure zones, while
individually unique, are all similar in
style in that they're basically super
narrow roads that have bank turns and
whatnot. You won't really need to dodge
mogul or trees, but a rock or two in the
middle is far from unheard of. Detonator
is also much longer than shortfuse.
The main run on the other side of the
lift is Parley's Park, which can be
accessed by starting down either side of
the motherload top terminal. If coming
off Bonanza, don't waste energy trying
to go uphill. Just go to the left of
that terminal and then traverse to your
right below the terminal. Since we're
talking about difficult access, getting
to the Summit House from Silver takes
quite the skate, and I would instead
recommend heading down to the Mid
Mountain Lodge, which we'll discuss
later.
When coming down Parley's Park, the
first left you'll then have access to is
SingleJack. Singlejack isn't anything
special, and I rarely ski it, but if you
want an easy way to get to Thes, that's
your route. Mikey's, I believe, is
groomed about once a week, but don't
quote me on that. Motherloadde Meadows
starts out fairly mild, but don't be
fooled. It earns that double black
rating in its lower half as you get into
these super steep and tight trees. Fools
Gold and Glory Hole are great black
mogul runs. After you pass all of these
turnoffs, Parley's Park comes to a
three-way intersection. If you go right,
as most people do, you'll head down
Prospector. As far as blacks go,
Prospector is one of the easiest you'll
find at Park City, as it's not terribly
steep. It is, however, quite busy and
icy as a result. If you go to the
middle, you'll continue down Parley's
Park, from which you will then have
another three-way intersection. The left
fork at the upper intersection is
Sunnyside, another fantastic blue
cruiser. Although, beware, it's only
groomed every other night. The left fork
of the lower fork is Carbide Cut, which
is groomed every night. That's the last
run you can take to access the
Motherload Express, and I would highly,
highly recommend taking it. Motherloads
lines only ever take a fraction of the
time as Silver Loads. If you have the
choice to take Motherload, take it. If
you keep right at that lower fork,
you'll keep on Parley's Park and end up
at Silver Load, which just isn't worth
it. If you go to the middle, you'll head
down my favorite adventure zone, TNT.
TNT is super duper long and just keeps
winding back and forth and back again.
It's kind of out here, so you're
unlikely to see anyone else. My only
word of warning is that in its lower
section, it has a couple spots that are
pretty steep for being so narrow of a
run. Everything we just discussed flows
into Th's Canyon, which is pitched just
enough that you typically don't have to
walk. But be aware that on powder or
slush days, you're not going to have a
fun time. If you miss Motherload, you'll
end up all the way down at King Con.
On the same side of the canyon above the
Motherload pod is Thes. You can access
Thes by coming from Pioneer or by taking
either Single Jack or Double Jack from
the Summit House area. Singlejack is a
pretty standard groomer, but be careful
not to accidentally continue on to
Mikey's. Doublejack is often mogul,
although it does get the occasional
groom. The other two blacks, things and
hoist, are some of the best single black
mogul runs on the entire park city side.
Thes is significantly busier, so I
prefer hoist. Keystone is a nice run for
its upper half, but then becomes a road.
There are better blues elsewhere, but
it's a nice rest lap between the mogul
runs. Fins is a double, but doesn't seem
nearly as bad of lines as Silver Load,
typically with weights more similar to
Motherload. It's not terribly slow and
not terribly long, but if you're truly
anti-fixed grip, you can continue down
Thes Canyon to Motherload. This section
can be pretty flat in spots, so I
typically just take the double. At the
top of things, you can access the
Jupiter access trail, but it requires
some skating uphill. you can't get to
Samson. And to get to these blues,
you'll have to s sideestep up to a gate
directly in front of the unload ramp. It
is much easier to reach those trails
from Pioneer, which is what we'll
discuss next.
The Pioneer Lift and Pod is home to some
of the most underrated intermediate and
advanced skiing on the Park City side.
If you're looking to get away from the
crowds, this is the place to do it. We
discussed the two mid- mountain runs
before, but both of them lead you to
this mid- mountain lodge, which is my
preferred place to get lunch on the park
city side. It's relatively tucked away
back here and thus doesn't get quite as
crowded as the summit house or miners
camp. In the upper skier's right side of
the pod is blue slip pole which has a
main area that's pretty steep but is
just mogulled and nothing too technical.
That main part of the bowl is only
accessible from things or pioneer. The
looker's right side of the bowl however
is a different story. Accessible through
a gate tucked behind the summit house.
You can find all sorts of gnarly cliffs,
rock bands and such. Back here on the
looker's left side under the lift, there
is some extremely steep and technical
tree skiing with some hidden cliffs.
This can be accessed through a gate on
Hawkeye. Hawkeye and these other two
blues are some of the quietest blue
cruisers anywhere on the park city side,
and I love them as such. Samson isn't
typically groomed, but it does get the
occasional run by the cats. In between
the bowl and blues is 10th Mountain,
which is home to some of the best single
black tree skiing on the mountain
village side of the resort. The runouts
from blue slip bowl are both typically
ungroomed while Woodside is always
groomed. It does seem odd to have it as
a green since it only comes from blues,
but it is quite mellow and fits the bill
of a green. Mid- Mountain Cutoff is
quite flat and should only be used to
access the lodge.
Just uphill from the bottom terminal of
Pioneer is the Maconi six-pack. The
bottoms of the two lifts are not right
next to each other, so be sure not to
accidentally ski past McConis and end up
being forced onto Pioneer. Off the top
of Mankis, there are some absolutely
fantastic panoramic views. On clear
days, I would recommend all
intermediates and above to head up here
at least once. Intermediates can descend
by taking Georgana, which is a groomer
that has some sections of road and some
sections of traditional slope, where
Georganna switches back. If you keep
going, you'll end up on Tycoon, a
sometimes groomed, sometimes not single
black with only one truly steep pitch.
That description works for all of the
single blacks here, also applying to
Sund Dog and Buckeye.
Maconi's Bowl is one of the more iconic
routes here and is a super steep bumped
up bowl. If you want a less steep
entrance, head down Sundog a little bit
before dropping in. Adjacent to the bowl
is Molly's, which is home to some
insanely steep tree skiing. The trees
get tighter the further skiers right you
go, but it also gets less steep and the
snow gets better in this direction.
Right at the top here, there are certain
areas with small drops and straight
lines if that interests you. Black
Forest is similar to Molly's, but
doesn't have as much technicality in its
entrance. Adjacent to the groomed runout
at the bottom here is Powder Monkey.
This is a super fun little goalie,
although beware that in low light it can
be hard to spot some of the little bumps
and jumps throughout. It drops you off
behind me, making it difficult to get
back to the maze. So, I recommend saving
it till your last rundown, so you can
just go straight to Pioneer.
through a gate adjacent to the top of
the lift. You can take a 15-minute hike
to the top of Jupiter Peak or shorten it
to 10 minutes to the ozone or 5 minutes
to the P zone. The Pzone starts off with
a big corners followed by some pretty
technical natural obstacles. Below that,
however, it turns into more traditional
tree skiing. If you want to skip the
upper part, you can go directly into the
trees by first heading down Sund Dog a
bit, then taking one of the lower gates.
The ozone also has a large cornis, but
is then a large bowl area. Off the
summit, there are some prominent cliffs
with a few shoots between. For brevity's
sake, we're not going to go line by
line, but I'm linking a resource below
if you want to check that out for
information on the individual lines. You
can also head down this ridge, which
then offers access to a variety of open
faces and more treated areas.
Over on the other side of the peak, the
Jupiter lift is the most tuckedway lift
at Park City and has no easy routes
down. This renders it much less popular
than mankis, and it serves a good
variety of terrain. If you're an expert
looking to get the best of Park City,
this is where it's at. To get to
Jupiter, you'll take the Jupiter access
road. And to exit, you'll take the upper
part of Thain's Canyon. Neither of these
are too horribly flat, but as an
alternative, you can also enter and exit
by hiking up to Jupiter Peak to and from
the Maconis side. You can hike up to the
peak from Maconis as previously
mentioned, but many guests will find the
hike from the Jupiter lift to that same
summit much easier as it is much
mellower. Off of this side of Jupiter
Peak, you'll have access to a plethora
of lines that are for the most part
steep open faces with trees lower down.
War Zone does have some drops and
straight lines at the top, while Dead
Tree, West Face, and First Bull are
relatively easier. War Zone can be
accessed without a hike, but the other
three will require a bit of stepping. On
a powder day, I would say it's
absolutely worth the hike up to these.
On a standard day, it's more like 50/50
for me. The next named lines over are
indicator and six bells. These are
extremely extremely narrow tree defined
shoots and are some of the hardest lines
in all of Park City. They are not
signed, but you can find them by keeping
an eye on your left for when the tracks
really start. These are super fun runs
and keep good snow because of how tucked
away they are. And while they are super
narrow, they're just perfectly wide
enough to make turns without having to
jump. To get to these, there is an
initial sideep skate just off the lift,
or you can bypass this by following
traverse tracks through the trees. All
in this area around the two lines is
some very difficult tree skiing as well
for those who aren't satisfied with the
shoots. Always ski with a partner in
this area.
The next line over is Silver Cliffs,
which is a wider chute that runs beneath
the namesake Silver Cliffs on the
skier's left. You can access this run by
heading on the traverse tracks we just
discussed or by entering directly
adjacent to the unloading ramp of the
lift. The ladder option will bring you
out below the cliffs onto a big mogul
area. This trio directly under the lift
are by far the most popular runs.
Fortune Teller has some cliffs and
straight lines in its upper section that
can be easily avoided. This area gets
blasted by the sun and thus doesn't hold
great snow. Main bull is the easiest way
down and is exactly what it sounds like.
Shadow Ridge is a more standard bump run
that goes right down the ridge, although
it has some cool variations if you know
where to look. Everything from indicator
to main bowl empties into this big treed
basin. At the end of the basin when you
exit the trees, have some speed because
you'll have a decent little traverse to
get back to the lift. If you're coming
down the ridge, just stick to your left
and you'll get dropped right back at the
lift. There are three named lines on the
looker's right side of the pod and the
run out from these isn't nearly as bad
as that on the other side. Portuguese
Gap is the first line and is easy to
miss. However, if you keep a good eye
out on your right, it is signed and you
should be able to find it. It's not very
far from the lift despite how it looks
on the map. Portuguese Gap is my
favorite line in Jupiter. It's a tree
shoot as well and is a little bit wider
than what you'll find on the other side.
There are two paths and I much prefer
the skiers right which is what you're
seeing here. The next line over is
Rhino. Rhino is this big spine from
which you can head into a big bowl on
the skier's left or into the trees on
the skier's right. Just past Rhino is
Scotsbull, the majority of which you'll
have to hike to access. It's not worth
it in my book, but to each his own. From
the top of Scottsole, you can continue
down the ridge to one of the entrances
to Pine Cone Ridge, which is our final
discussion point.
The Pine Cone Ridge terrain offers some
of the most isolated backcountesque
terrain you'll find at any Veil Resort
anywhere. The most efficient way to
access these lines is to hike from
Scotsole off Jupiter for everything down
to noon moon and hike up from the
Quicksilver Midstation for Limelight,
Homelight, and Sam's Knob. All of this
area offers some great variety with
trees, gullies, open faces, and more to
explore. These moon runs are the best
places to get some powder, and they're
not that much further than mine, such as
Pine Cone, because you can ski down the
main ridge from there. These are all
fantastic runs, and it's absolutely
worth doing a Pine Cone Ridge run once.
However, be warned that the nature of
this terrain makes it an absolute pain
for patrol, and it often only opens for
a few weeks out of the season. The one
line I will caution you about is
Limelight, as its lower half is very
rarely open, in which case you'll have
to skate or walk another 5 to 10 minutes
along the flat lights out traverse to
get to some open gates. If you're going
to Pine Cone via the Quicksilver Gondola
from the canyon side, Limelight is all
you have access to, so it may be better
to ride it down and then back up to get
off on the other side of the mid
station. Other than that, Pine Cone
Ridge is an area best explored, not
discussed. So, we'll leave it off there.
All right, that about wraps it up for
the town side of Park City. A shout out
to Miller Hall and Gus Batson for
correctly guessing the mystery run in
the California Extremes video. If you
want to get shouted out just like this,
keep an eye out for mystery runs and
guess them in the comments. As always,
please leave any questions down below.
Thank you all for watching. All my love,
I'm out.
