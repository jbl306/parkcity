Hello everybody and welcome to Insiders
Guide. Today we're discussing one of the
best family-friendly ski resorts in all
of North America, Park City. Because the
mountain is mammoth, this episode is
split into four parts with the first two
about the Park City side and this part
wrapping up our discussion of the canyon
side. We began in part C. If you haven't
already, be sure to check out part C to
get some valuable background information
about the canyon side. With that, let's
finish an Insiders Guide to Ski Resorts
Park City.
We'll pick up right where we left off in
part C at the Red Pine Lodge. Now, from
Redpine Lodge, lots of people want to
get to this big area to the Looker's
left side of canyons. There are two ways
to get there, but unfortunately, both
routes require taking the same run,
which is arguably the worst run on the
entire canyon side. Chicane. Chicane is
fairly wide and fairly mellow, but it
genuinely feels like skiing down an
interstate highway. You can jump off
Chicane onto the Chicane bypass signed
as Tombstone Alley in person. This is
just a road, but it gets you around the
Chicane traffic where it intersects
Cloud9. It's not signed, but be sure to
continue across because if you go left
onto Cloud 9, you'll end up right back
on Chicane. Lower Chicane is also a
little bit flat just to pile onto this
already dreaded run. I would highly
highly recommend avoiding both Chicane
and Chicane bypass as much as possible.
If you survive the rundown, you'll come
to a compact and crowded little area.
The main lift here is, of course, the
Tombstone Express, which we'll come back
to in a second. If you hike across a
little bit, you can get to Timberline,
which is one of two ways to get over to
the southern half of canyons. Timberline
is a two-way lift, so be aware of
traffic unloading as well. You can also
take over and out, which is my
recommendation for getting back to the
base area. Down here is the Tombstone
Barbecue Joint, which is one of my
favorite places to grab lunch on
mountain.
The Tombstone Express is a major choke
point. There's no better way to put it.
It's effectively the silver load of the
canyon side, as you have to ride it to
get to 9990 and Peak 5. It serves some
good terrain itself, and it's a major
piece of the egress from some other
mountain areas. If you're returning from
Iron Mountain, Dreamcatcher, Dreamscape,
Daybreak, Peak 5, or the Park Cityside
via the Quicksilver Gondola, you'll get
dropped to Tombstone. Remember that you
have Over and Out as an option. And
later in the day, while Tombstone may be
super busy, heading to Orange Bubble and
that side of the mountain may not be
nearly as bad. But of course, that
doesn't address the fantastic terrain
that Tombstone directly serves. So,
let's go ahead and get to that. Now,
we already discussed chicane, but if for
some sick reason you want to lap it, you
have a few options. By far the easiest
is Red Pine Road, which can require some
skating on slower days. For access back
to this Red Pine Lodge area, I much
prefer Sidewinder, which is an awesome
black that gets rotating grooming along
with Sister Run Cloud9. Both of these
are pretty steep, but are fantastic
cruising laps when groomed. While they
are quite popular, they never feel too
crowded and they each have a nice
consistent pitch. Between Sidewinder and
Red Pine Road is an experts only area
consisting of Grande and Desut. Grande
has some pretty sparse trees and might
seem easy initially, but it has a pretty
big cliff band halfway down you'll need
to work through or around. Desuites is a
super underrated area consisting of
multiple tree shoots hidden in the
woods. These are super flowy and nice
and long. And because they're hidden in
the woods, they tend to keep some pretty
good snow as well.
If you're already on Red Pine Road from
Tombstone or the backside of 9990, you
can access Pinball Alley. It's a fairly
mellow natural goalie that's plenty wide
and fairly short. It's far from the most
exhilarating run around. Down towards
the bottom of Sidewinder, you have the
option to take Encore. Encore is
certainly the road less taken, and it
typically has a nice little mogul field
at the end. Parallel to Cloud9 is
Escapade Woods, a nice glad area that
flows down into a gentle natural gully.
Beware that you can't really exit it
until it intersects Tombstone Alley. So,
be sure you're ready to descend all that
vertical before you commit.
To access Cloud9 and Sidewinder, you'll
need to make a U-turn off the unload
ramp and then keep left at the fork. If
you keep right at the fork, you'll head
to Diamond Ridge and Paradise. Both
forks are pretty flat, short roads that
get you to the tops of the true runs.
Diamond Ridge honestly would be a blue
were it not for one steep pitch. It has
moguls, but it's super mellow for the
most part. It does make for a great
cardio run. However, if you go right
down under the lift or drop off the
uppermost part of Cloud9, you'll head
down this big muled bowl. If you drop
off the left of Diamond Ridge, you'll be
in the paradise shoots. These are not
true shoots, but are called that because
they resemble tree shoots from afar.
They're not the steepest nor too
technical, so the only limiting factor
is they're relatively narrow. Opposite
the paradise shoots is a face containing
thunder and lightning, which gets a ton
of sun. If conditions are good, however,
they offer some nice thin glades. All of
this will drop you into a runout that
takes you to another world. If you
choose to continue in the bowl below
that road, you will have a pretty nasty
creek crossing to contend within spots,
so be careful.
Far and away the most popular option off
the top of Tombstone is to head in the
direction of Another World. Another
World is an absolutely classic blue
cruiser, albeit just a touch steep and
icy on its first pitch. It is however
immensely popular, so I would highly
highly recommend hitting it first thing
in the morning. Partway down the ridge,
you'll have the option to keep right to
South Fork, which is just a road that
continues down the ridge just a bit
before switching back to rejoin another
world. It does, however, offer access to
the steep cruiser, the drop, and its
less crazy counterpart, Tranquility.
Tranquility is only a black because of
one semi- steep pitch that goes into a
fairly tight curve. Its vibe matches its
name, that being tranquil, and I do
enjoy it more than another world or the
drop. Contrary to how it appears on the
trail map, you cannot get to South Fork
and thus the drop and tranquility from
Diamond Ridge.
Off the top of Tombstone, you can take
Silver Spur, a decently pitched road to
get to Peak 5 and 9990. The bottom of
the two lifts are a decent little skate
apart, so make sure you know where you
want to go before you go, so you don't
accidentally end up at the wrong one and
have to hike all the way back to the
other. Alternatively, you can take rips
off from another world, which is a cute
little groomer through the colony, but I
would only recommend that if you're
going to 9990, as it drops you a ways
from Peak 5.
The 9990 Express really feels like the
Grass Mountain Express at Beaver Creek
to me for those of you who know that
area. It mostly consists of double black
Mughal runs, although there are some
gnarlier lines spread throughout, unlike
at Beaver Creek. Let's start over on
this backside with the red pine shoots.
To access this area, there's a pretty
prominent traverse you can take. If you
drop in right after crossing the ridge
line, you'll be on Magic Line. Keep
going a bit until the trees thin a
little bit for Charlie Brown. Go all the
way to the far boundary line for the Red
Pine shoot. Now, if you're picturing
some big long rock defined shoot like
this, today is not your lucky day,
unfortunately. This whole area is
relatively underwhelming. And while
there are some short shoots, small
cliffs and the likes, it isn't all it's
made out to be in my opinion. For the
most part, it's more of just some
intermittent tree skiing, some faces,
and moguls here and there. There is lots
of space to explore back here, but all
of this will funnel you back to Red Pine
Road and then back to Tombstone. As
such, it's a two-lift lap and not an
easy two lifts either. Thus, I typically
save doing anything in this area until
I'm ready to leave 9990.
If you go down the ridge on the looker's
right side, but drop back into the lift
serve side, you'll be headed down Dutch
Hollow. Don't be fooled by the mild
ridge as it quickly drops into a super
steep face that can be quite rocky in
spots. A much easier line is Fright
Gully, which is a pretty wide gully that
has huge moguls all the way down. 94
turns is the most iconic line in the pot
and is accessed by a very short bout of
sidstepping to the left of the unload
ramp. This is a super wide face with
legitimately Volkswagen sized moguls.
This is an absolute must hit for all
experts at canyons despite it not being
the craziest or most interesting run
ever. Just lookers left of the lift
between 94 turns and fright goalie is
another super steep face with small
shoots, cliffs, straight lines and the
likes. I would say that this is the
gnarliest area within the directly lifts
serve zone. The bottom of this zone and
94 turns gives you three options. Marine
and Aspen Grove are more of single black
difficulty and are just classic trees
mixed with some mogul here and there.
Talis Garden starts off with more
moguls, like 94 turns before opening up
to this big open meadow. It's not really
steep enough to develop moguls here.
Then it crosses escape and becomes a
short narrow natural goalie that brings
you to peak five. Off the top of the
9990 lift, you can also take a quick
hike up to the true summit for access to
a medium-sized face or easier access to
the backside shoots. I don't find it
worth it for either purpose, to be
honest.
The next lift over from 9990 is Peak 5,
which serves a little bit of extreme
terrain in its own right. The abyss here
looks like standard tree skiing from the
top, but don't be fooled. It quickly
develops into some of the gnarliest
terrain in Park City with a series of
shoots ranging from Golden Broom to
Geronimo, which you'll find signed in
person by patrol. It is possible to
avoid the shoots and stay in the trees
by sticking to the skier's left side.
However, you absolutely should not enter
the abyss without due preparation to hit
a chute, even if you're not planning on
it. Abyss goes perpendicular down the
skier's left side of the lift, but if
you stay parallel to the lift on the
skier's right side, you'll have some
really good tree skiing. I would highly
recommend checking out Mystic Pines, and
I would much sooner recommend it than
areas like Condor Woods, Tree Time, and
Black Hole on the lower mountain.
Also, off of Peak 5, you have access to
the spaghetti looking mess of blues
through the colony here. These runs get
rotating grooming for the most part, but
are taken care of enough not to get
bumps. My favorite of these is Crowning
Glory. All of these runs go through a
rather affluent neighborhood flanked by
multi multi-million dollar residences
all while dipping over and under the
road network. The exception is Power
Alley, which is more of a road that
returns you to Peak 5. I find these runs
super fun as they're typically pretty
quiet and they're super long, which is
an added bonus for me. However, the
major downside of Serenity and
Everything Lookers Right is that they
dump you back at Tombstone. That means
they're two lift laps, which while not
the worst thing in the world, is more
annoying than it could be.
If you take Upper Harmony, Solace, or
Royal, you can access these three lifts
that form the backbone of the Southern
Canyon's terrain. This is the most
popular method, going Tombstone to Peak
5 to get to Dreamscape. But another good
option is to take Timberline to Iron
Mountain to get to Dreamcatcher. This
route is useful when Tombstone has a big
line. Let's start with the most
underrated of these three lifts,
Daybreak. Daybreak doesn't serve much
terrain, but the blues that it does
serve are some of the quietest in all of
canyons. These three blues on the
Looker's right of the pod get rotating
grooming, but there's typically at least
one route down that's not bumped up. The
runs on the Looker's left are more
consistently groomed. The other lift
option from where Daybreak starts is
Dreamscape. This lift gets a little bit
busier than Daybreak, but typically
doesn't exceed 5 minutes except on the
busiest days. It is unfortunately a
fixed grip and is significantly longer
than Daybreak. Its ride is typically in
the ballpark of 10 minutes, which I
personally can't stand a ton of laps on.
Panorama is the easiest run in the pod,
but it's effectively a glorified road
for its entire length. All of these runs
from Dja Vu through Snow Meadow are
fantastic Blue Mughal runs, the best in
all of Park City. Daydream is the
busiest, so I avoid it. My favorite is
Bliss, as you have to start down Dja Vu
under the lift to access it, so it's
somewhat hidden. Snow Meadow is the
widest and mellowest, while McDonald's
Meadow offers a super wide straight area
to practice. There is good intermediate
tree skiing between all the runs and
there are some more advanced level trees
just past Snow Meadow. I'd like to point
out Back Street here because while it
may initially look like a nice quiet
alternative to the busy Panorama runout,
it is pretty flat in some places.
Alpenlow goes right down the ridge line
and is pretty consistently groomed.
However, it gets pretty narrow down here
and where Alpenlow and Panorama merge
before the lift bottoms gets quite
congested. So, ski this area with
caution. You cannot get to Dreamscape
and Daybreak from Sleeper, even though
it's real close on the map.
Off of Alpen Glow, you've got Twilight,
Mirage, and Apparition, all of which are
blue groomers that take you to the
Dreamcatcher quad. Be careful as you
cannot get to Dreamcatcher directly from
the bottom of Dreamscape. You must ride
up Dreamscape in order to access
Alpenlow first. Now, if you thought
Dreamscape's ride time was bad,
Dreamcatcher has a base ride time of 10
minutes plus near constant stops and
slows, which often takes its ride time
north of 15 minutes. This is extra
unfortunate given that Dreamcatcher
serves some of my personal favorite
terrain in canyons. Directly off of
Alonglow and Twilight are Spectre and
Fool's Paradise. These two areas consist
of several cut lines that have moguls
along with lots of solid tree skiing to
duck into. Just be aware that in the
bottom of the pod, you can accidentally
find yourself in some small thicket, so
keep an eye out way ahead. Directly
under the lift towards the top is
Chimera. This run tends to keep some
really good snow because it's shaded by
tall trees on both sides. It is a mogul
run, but is exceedingly steep and would
in all likelihood be rated as a double
black and many other mountains. There is
some expert only tree skiing on either
side of Chimera as well. Fantasm,
Boogeyman, and Pipedream all get
rotating grooming. Although Boogeyman
seems to get it the most frequently when
groomed, these are great long cruisers
that are pretty steep in their upper
portions. Even a few days removed from
Fresh Cord, Fantasm still typically skis
well. The same cannot be said for
Pipedream, however, as it gets lots of
sun and as a result gets quite icy. I
wouldn't recommend Pipeream except for
when it's gotten groomed overnight. Pipe
Dream does have one semi- steep pitch,
but when groomed, it's definitely the
easiest of these three. At the summit of
Dreamcatcher and Dreamscape is Cloud
Dine, which is a great less busy spot to
grab some lunch or simply take a break.
Off the backside of this summit is some
of the quietest terrain in all of Park
City. With the exception of Bugle Ridge,
all routes here start by heading down
upper trance, which is a moderately
pitched road. Off the skier's left side
is a precipitously pitched face with
small patches of trees here and there.
This is Shadowlands and it's honestly
more of a double black than a single to
me. Once you get to the bottom of Upper
Trance, you'll have the option to take a
left onto Sandman. Do it. While Sandman
isn't the steepest run in the world,
trance quickly becomes quite flat, so
it's best reserved solely for real
estate access. When you get to the
bottom of these runs, you'll have to
take the Flat Iron Double, the only
double chair on the canyon side.
Unfortunately, to lap this terrain, it
is two lifts, requiring both Flat Iron
and Dreamcatcher. Flat Iron seats are
incredibly uncomfortable for some
reason, but thankfully it's not too long
of a ride. It has two midstations,
either of which you can unload at if you
want to head back to Dreamcatcher.
At the end of Flat Iron, you'll have
access to the Quicksilver Gondola. This
is how you get to the Park City side.
So, to review, the fastest way to get to
the park city side is to take any of the
three out of base lifts, get to
Timberline, and then take Iron Mountain,
just the same as if you wanted to go to
Cloud9 as we discussed earlier. The
other method is Tombstone to Peak 5 to
Dreamscape to Flat Iron. And while this
is the more scenic route, it takes
significantly longer. Quicksilver has a
pretty low capacity, so it can see some
solid buildup on peak days in the early
morning and late afternoon. If you're
going on a weekend or holiday, I would
highly recommend picking one side to ski
for the whole day and starting and
ending your day on that side. If you're
staying in the village, however, you'll
just have to deal with the lines. Do
recall that you have the option to take
a bus between the two base areas as
well. If you want to go to the park city
side from canyons, you're going to want
to ride all the way across, lest you'll
have to ski some pretty steep double
black terrain we discussed in part B.
Coming the other way, however, you can
unload at this midstation to access a
handful of blue cruisers. Both Blaz's
Way and the highway are great blues for
their upper 2/3, but both get pretty
flat towards the bottom because they go
around a pond. If you take a left off
Blaze's Way onto Snow Wonder, however,
you'll be able to have a nice continuous
cruiser all the way down. Mimi's Way
goes from the highway to Blaz's way and
serves no purpose other than real estate
access. From Blaz's way, Mimi's actually
continues into this closed area on the
map as real estate access. However,
there is no sign telling you this and it
is instead signed just like every other
intersection at the mountain. If you
turn onto Mimis from Blazes, you will
end up at the wrong end of Flat Iron and
will have to ride it back across. Just
don't turn onto Mimis. Higher up off
Blazes is an access gate to a trail
network that serves the local real
estate, but there are plenty of warning
signs here. White Pine, Golden Spruce,
and Snow Wonder, all of which are
extremely mellow, bring you down to this
big, steep, icy face into the
Dreamcatcher Bottom Terminal. You can go
around it via a road here signed as
Cascade. At the Dreamcatcher Bottom, you
can choose to continue to Timberline or
Iron Mountain via the Cascade Trail. If
you're coming from the park city side
and wanting to get to the main canyon
side as fast as possible, this will be
your route. any of these cruisers to
Cascade to Timberline.
The final pod we have to discuss here is
Iron Mountain, which is typically a
fairly quiet pod in comparison to some
of the other areas at Canyons. Most
people use this lift just to get to
Quicksilver, but it has some very solid
skiing in its own right. Lines here tend
to mirror Dreamcatcher and Dreamscape.
This is one of two themed lifts at
canyons, the other being OBX, as Iron
Mountain sports orange on orange
terminals and some gorgeous orange seat
cushions. As far as trails go, Mercury
and Copperhead are the two consistently
groomed runs. Mercury is a pretty
standard cruiser, albeit nice and long
and empty. Copperhead, however, has lots
of flat spots and is thus not my
favorite. Silver Streak is extremely
sunexposed on its bottom half, leading
to it being closed for large portions of
the season. Even when it is open, it
typically has poor coverage, so I avoid
it as well. Double nickel and lead foot
are where it gets interesting, as they
don't get groomed every night. Sometimes
Double Nickel will even have some mogul.
These are great runs to first work on
some ungroomed stuff. Iron Man is the
lift line and has some nice mogul, while
Heavy metal is pretty commonly groomed
and is only black because of its pitch.
All of these runs come together into one
big wide runout, which then splits again
lower down. The skier's left path,
despite looking flatter, is my preferred
route as it is much wider and has way
better snow. The skier's right side,
overwhelmingly more popular, is quite
narrow and gets extremely icy. Cobalt
woods and platinum woods are pretty low
in elevation and can thus have
semiscarce coverage. There are better
trees elsewhere. Finally, to leave the
pod, you can take the excruciatingly
flat upper white pine, the super
sunexposed and icy tin cup, or the most
popular option, the chrome alley road.
Additionally, you've got Goldfinger,
which is a mogul run, but it also gets
lots of sun and is a skip for me.
All right, that about wraps it up for
Park City. Now, go check out another
episode of Insiders Guide, all about
other great ski areas around the world.
As always, please leave any questions
down below. Thank you all so much for
watching. All my love, I'm out.
