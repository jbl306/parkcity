---

## PARK CITY SIDE (Mountain Village)

### Town Lift *(fixed grip triple — long ride, rarely has lines)*
- 🟦 **Creole** — Preferred ski-to-town route, straight down the face, scenic bridge into downtown; gets slushy even mid-season
- 🟦 **Quinton Time** — More road segments going around; Creole is the better choice

### Eagle *(triple)*
- ⬛ **CBS** — Fantastic steep cruiser, but often closed for racing

### Three Kings *(triple with loading carpet — trust it, you load directly off carpet)*
- Serves the largest terrain parks at PC: big/medium jumps + large halfpipe — decent but not world-class

### First Time *(detachable — ski school prioritized in maze, slow general public line)*
- 🟩 **First Time** — True bunny hill, fully segregated from advanced traffic; great learning spot
- 🟦 **Silver Hollow** — Quite mild for a blue, only accessible from Three Kings
- 🟩 **Turtle Trail / Stoope** — Gentle beginner slopes leading to Home Run

### Payday *(main out-of-base lift — busy mornings, excellent afternoon laps)*
- 🟦 **Payday** — Marquee run; excellent wide cruiser, best in pod
- 🟦 **King's Crown** — Starts mild then gets narrower and steeper than expected

- ⬛ **Widowmaker** — Standard long black bump run
- ⬛ **Nail Driver** — Standard long black bump run

- 🟩 **Home Run** — Wide for most part, narrows at corners; shortcut switchbacks via Lower Silver Skis
- 🟦 **Lower Silver Skis** — Easy side of blue, unsigned but prominent entrance
- 🟩 **Drift** — Narrow and very busy; avoid if possible (only real use: accessing town runs from upper mountain)
- ⬛ **Waterfall** — Deceptively mild start, develops into serious mogul field quickly

### Crescent *(out-of-base lift — busy mornings, great for black mogul laps)*
- ⬛ **Crescent** — Very steep entrance, NOT intermediate level
- 🟦 **Silver Queen** — Blue groomer; popular so gets mogulled/icy by end of day; flat route from top via U-turn at yurt
- ⬛ **Shaft** — Old lift line, straight and narrow; short side-step up discourages crowds — favorite run in pod
- ⬛ **Silver Skis / Silver King / Willy's Run** — Rotating grooming, develop decent bumps between grooms
- ⬛ **Erica's Gold** — Biggest and baddest moguls on this ridge
- 🟦 **Women's** — Blue only because it's mellower than neighbors; still fairly steep
- 🟦 **Gotcha Cutoff** — Winding road, best way to escape King Con and avoid major choke point (Part B)

### King Con *(can get busy but lines move fast)*
- ⬛ **King Kong** — Groomed nightly but one of steepest runs + busiest; try to avoid

- 🟦 **Silverstar** — Great groomed lap, rarely busy, often no one else on it
- ⬛ **Ligy Split** — Standard mogul run

### Bonanza *(access lift to rest of mountain — decent lines but not as bad as expected)*
- 🟩 **Home Run** — Primary green; initial section EXTREMELY busy with merging traffic — ski with extreme caution

- 🟦 **Quarter Load** — Widest of the load runs
- 🟦 **Hidden Splendor / Assessment** — Good blue cruisers; not always groomed nightly

- 🟦 **Lost Prospector / Newport / Dynamite** — Groomed often enough to stay smooth
- 🟩 **Shortfuse** — Fun adventure run
- 🟩 **Detonator** — Much longer adventure run, harder to reach via Mel's Alley — preferred over Shortfuse

- 🟦 **SingleJack** — Nothing special; usable as easy route to Thaynes

- 🟩 **TNT** — Favorite adventure zone; super long, winding, mostly empty; lower section steeper than expected for narrow run

### Thaynes *(fixed grip double — not as slow/long as you'd think)*
- ⬛ **Things** — One of best single black mogul runs on PC side
- ⬛ **Hoist** — One of best single black mogul runs; less busy than Things — preferred
- 🟦 **Keystone** — Nice upper half, then becomes a flat road; better blues elsewhere

### Pioneer *(underrated — best place to escape crowds on PC side)*
- ⬛⬛ **Blue Slip Bowl (main)** — Steep mogulled face, not too technical

- ⬛⬛ **McConkey's Bowl** — Iconic, super steep bumped-up bowl; enter via Sun Dog for less steep start

- ⬛⬛ **Black Forest** — Similar to Molly's, less technical entrance
- ⬛ **Powder Monkey** — Super fun gully; watch for hidden bumps in low light; dumps behind lodge so save for last run down

### Jupiter Peak *(hike access from McConkey's top — 5-15 min depending on zone)*
- ⬛⬛ **P-Zone** (5 min hike) — Big cornice → technical natural obstacles → traditional trees; skip upper via lower gates off Sun Dog
- ⬛⬛ **O-Zone** (10 min hike) — Large cornice → large bowl area

### Jupiter Lift *(most tucked-away lift at PC, no easy routes down — best expert terrain)*
- ⬛⬛ **War Zone** — Drops and straight lines at top; no hike needed
- ⬛⬛ **Dead Tree / West Face / First Bull** — Relatively easier open faces; require some stepping; worth it on powder days

- ⬛⬛ **Limelight** — Lower half rarely open; may require 5-10 min flat traverse if closed

## CANYONS SIDE

### Cabriolet *(open-air standing gondola — fastest-moving lines at PC)*
- Links parking/transit hub to Canyons Village

### Orange Bubble Express (OBX) *(has midstation + protective bubble covers — 5 min shorter lines than Red Pine)*

- 🟩 **Red Pine Road** — Easiest route to Red Pine Lodge; may need skating
- ⬛ **Sidewinder** — Awesome steep cruiser with rotating grooming; fantastic laps, never feels crowded
- ⬛ **Cloud 9** — Sister run to Sidewinder; rotating grooming, equally steep and fantastic

- ⬛ **Marine / Aspen Grove** — Single black difficulty; classic trees/moguls
- ⬛ **Talis Garden** — Moguls → open meadow → narrow natural gully to Peak 5

### Peak 5
- ⬛⬛ **The Abyss** — Looks like standard trees from top; develops into gnarliest terrain at PC with series of named chutes; do NOT enter without cliff/chute preparation
- ⬛ **Mystic Pines** — Really good tree skiing; much better than Condor Woods/Black Hole on lower mountain
- 🟦 **Colony blues (Crowning Glory, etc.)** — Rotating grooming, super long through affluent neighborhood; quiet and fun; Serenity + right side = 2-lift lap via Tombstone

- 🟦 **Back Street** — Looks like quiet alternative to Panorama but flat in places

### Dreamcatcher *(fixed grip, 10 min base + constant stops = 15+ min real ride — serves great terrain)*
- ⬛ **Spectre / Fool's Paradise** — Several cut mogul lines + solid tree skiing; watch for thickets at bottom
- ⬛⬛ **Chimera** — Under lift; keeps great snow (shaded); exceedingly steep moguls; would be double black at most mountains

- **Cloud Dine** — Great less-busy lunch/break spot at summit

### Flat Iron Double *(uncomfortable seats but short ride — 2 midstations)*
- Transit to Quicksilver Gondola + Dreamcatcher access via midstations

### Quicksilver Gondola *(connects PC side ↔ Canyons — low capacity, busy on peak days)*

- ⬛ **Lead Foot** — Not groomed nightly; great for practicing ungroomed
- ⬛ **Iron Man** — Lift line with nice moguls
