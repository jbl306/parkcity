Hello everybody and welcome to Insiders
Guide. Today we're discussing the
largest ski resort in the United States,
Park City. Park City's sheer scale can
be quite intimidating to navigate, but
in these videos, we'll be going over
everything you need to know to see all
the mountain has to offer as efficiently
as possible. Because of the sheer scale
of the mountain, this episode is split
into four parts, and this initial part
will be background on the townside and
discussion of the lower mountain. So,
without any further ado, let's begin an
insiders guide to ski resorts, Park
City.
Now, before we jump into the on mountain
tips, let's roll through some important
background information. Park City is one
of the most known names as far as North
American ski resorts go, and that's for
a reason. Park City as a town is pretty
famous. The mountain is one of the most
popular around, and it's one of the
largest resorts on the continent. On top
of that, the mountain is located on the
east faces of the Wasach Range between a
halfhour and hour drive from the Salt
Lake City airport via Interstate 80.
While I80 and the routes into town can
get pretty backed up, it's not nearly as
bad as you might find in Colorado or
around Lake Tahoe. Thus, it is possible
to stay in Salt Lake City and day trip
if you're trying to save money.
Although, I would still highly, highly
recommend to stay in or around Park City
if it's within your means.
Park City Mountain Resort, as it's known
officially, has two base areas, as it
used to be two different ski areas.
While there is a gondola connecting the
two sides of the resort, it is difficult
to get between the two base areas. So,
if possible, I would recommend starting
in the base village of the side you're
planning to ski on that day. We'll cover
the canyon side in part C. So, for now,
let's just discuss the town side,
officially signed on mountain as
mountain village. The main base area is
located on the edge of the town of Park
City. However, rather uniquely, the
mountain also offers the option to ski
in and out directly from downtown. We'll
discuss that much more specifically once
we switch to the trail map. Staying in
downtown is by far the most expensive
option, and staying right at the
mountain village isn't far behind.
However, there are plenty of more
affordable options the further out from
the town center you get. You can drive
to the mountain in the mornings, but as
mentioned before, the town does have
some traffic issues. Additionally, all
Mountain Village parking lots require
reservations and payment unless you
carpool with four or more. A much better
option is to take the reliable town bus
system, which is completely free and
offers some pretty good coverage and
frequency. If you're planning to take
the bus system at any point, I would
highly, highly recommend downloading the
transit app. In the app, you can type in
the address of your final destination,
and it'll give you step-by-step
directions on the buses. It makes it a
million times easier.
To many of you, there's a bit of an
elephant in the room. Park City is a
name known all over the world.
Additionally, Park City is on the Epic
Pass and is the only epic mountain in
Utah to boot, and as such, both the
mountain and town can get absolutely
slammed with crowds during peak times.
Don't get me wrong, there are still
plenty of quiet areas, which we'll cover
throughout this episode. However, if you
can, I would highly, highly recommend
avoiding the week between Christmas and
New Year's and the January and February
holiday weekends. While I know this can
be said for almost every ski resort,
trust me when I say that Park City gets
it some of the worst. It is a truly day
andight difference. Park City doesn't
get as crazy of snow accumulation as the
neighboring Cottonwood Canyons, but it
still does offer a very respectable
seasonal average, and it snow is
typically pretty high quality. However,
the relatively low elevation of the base
areas can lead to fairly rapid
deterioration come springtime, so be a
little wary of booking anything past
mid-March too far in advance.
Now, one thing that does help with
crowds a little bit is that Park City is
the largest ski resort in the United
States, albeit somewhat controversially.
We're not going to get into the
nitty-gritty and numbers here, but trust
me when I say that the mountain looks,
feels, and skis big. There are endless
new areas to explore, and you can easily
spend a week here without seeing it all.
Throughout the episode, we'll highlight
some of the best areas to check out.
Because it's so massive, it has a solid
variety of terrain for all ability
levels, but beginner terrain is somewhat
limited. As such, I would recommend a
minimum of low intermediate if you're
planning to experience the mountain
yourself or taking a lesson if you're a
beginner. For those who aren't skiing,
there's a mountain coaster, a skating
rink, and some zip lines in the mountain
village, which are quite fun. A dozen
different snowmobile tour companies, and
plenty of other entertainment in the
town of Park City itself. They do love
their concerts and DJ sets, both at the
ski resort and in town. All right, that
ought to adequately set us up. So, let's
go ahead and discuss the on- mountain
experience.
Let's go ahead and start off with the
town lift, which as the name implies
comes from right in downtown. This lift
is a fixed grip triple, meaning it has
an excruciatingly long ride time.
However, aside from some small backups
in the morning, it tends not to get any
lines. To ski back into town, you'll
need to get to this junction here by
taking either payday or drift, both of
which we'll discuss in just a second.
You can also ride down the lift if you'd
like. As far as skiing down goes, I much
prefer heading down Creole as it goes
straight down the face while Quinton
time has more road segments that go
around. Both are standard blue cruisers.
They are quite low in elevation, so they
can get slushy even in the peak season.
However, one of my favorite things to do
here is to come down Creole to grab
lunch in town, which gets you onto
Creole before the rush comes in the
afternoon and also allows you to avoid
the crowds at the on- mountain
restaurants. It's also super scenic,
crossing this big bridge right into the
heart of the town. So, I would recommend
for all intermediates and higher to ski
down to town at least once.
Additionally, on busier days, taking a
bus into town and heading up from there
will often allow you to bypass longer
lines at the primary villages.
Now, let's jump over to the mountain
village. A large majority of the parking
lot is down by this trio of Eagle, Three
Kings, and First Time. The base of Three
Kings is located a bit uphill, so this
makes it highly appealing to head to
First Time in order to gain the
elevation necessary to access Payday and
Crescent. This can cause first time to
get some pretty monstrous lines early in
the day. For intermediate level and
above skiers and borders, I would highly
highly recommend heading up Eagle from
which you can pop over to King Con and
on up from there or head down Gotcha
Cutoff to get to the main lifts. We'll
discuss why in part B, but I would
recommend the ladder option to head back
down to the main base. Directly lapable
via Eagle, you have CBS, which is often
closed for racing, but is a fantastic
steep cruiser when open. There are signs
at the base that instruct the public not
to unload at the midstation here as
these other two blacks are almost always
closed for racing as well. Adjacent to
Eagle is three kings, another triple.
This one has a loading carpet and thus
runs quite fast for a fix grip. The
timing of the gates and carpet may feel
a little weird the first time you ride
it, but just trust it. You'll load the
chair directly from the carpet, whereas
on a detachable, the carpet just takes
you to the loading line. Its primary
purpose is to serve all the large
terrain parks. And because of its bottom
terminal location, for the most part,
this is also its only purpose. These
parks have the largest features in Park
City, mostly consisting of large and
medium jumps and a large halfpipe. Park
City isn't exactly known for its terrain
parks. And while not exactly world
class, these features are no slump. For
non-p park skiers, if First Time is
extremely backed up, you can still make
the hike the extra ways up to three
kings to skip the line and still be able
to hit the bunny hill. The first time
lift is a detachable, but still suffers
from a litany of loading and unloading
problems. Its maze highly prioritizes
ski school, so beware that the general
public line may not be very long
physically, but can take a long time to
get through. Silver Hollow is only
accessible from three kings and goes
back around here. It's quite mild for a
blue. First time, however, accessible
from both lifts is the true bunny hill.
It is fully segregated from advanced
traffic, making it a great place to
learn. Turtle Trail and Stoope are nice,
gentle slopes that go away from First
Time and drop you onto Home Run. There
is a magic carpet on the side of Home
Run and another below Crescent, although
I'm not sure if either are open to the
public. Regardless, their locations put
them right in the middle of all the
crowds coming down the main funnel, and
despite them being fenced off, it can
still feel quite intimidating to first
timers.
All right, now we can finally talk about
the main two out of base lifts. The
easiest to access walking out of the
village is Payday. But if you're looking
to get to the canyon side quickly,
you're going to want to walk a little
bit further to get up to Crescent. They
tend to get similar length lines, so for
most people, I would recommend just
heading to Payday. Payday primarily is
used just to get elsewhere on the
mountain via Bonanza, but it serves a
solid pod in its own right. Although the
low elevation can make these runs icier
or slushier than the higher elevation
terrain pods. Due to their nature as the
main out of base lifts, Payday and
Crescent both get quite busy in the
mornings. However, they make for some
excellent afternoon laps.
The marquee run in the Payday Pod is
Payday itself, which is an excellent
wide blue cruiser. Down below, you can
split off to King's Crown, which starts
off pretty mild, but then becomes
narrower and steeper. Heckler isn't
groomed nightly and can sometimes
develop small moguls. Blanch is a pretty
standard green with this adventure zone
running parallel. Alloy Alley tends to
get pretty bare, so I prefer the upper
mountain adventure runs. If you want
some standard long black bump runs, then
Widowmaker and Nail Driver are calling
your name. Dividend also isn't groomed
nightly, but it's a pretty short cut
down to Treasure Hollow. There is some
solid advanced tree skiing between
Dividend and Widowmaker when conditions
allow. Treasure Hollow is the main run
down in the valley here, and as such
gets quite busy, although it is fairly
wide. The easiest way down is via Home
Run, which can be accessed from Payday
via the Bonanza Access Cat Track.
Bonanza Access is pretty flat, but also
very short. Home Run itself is wide for
the most part, but does get narrow
around some of these corners. You can
shortcut some of the switchbacks on
lower silver skis, which is on the
easier side of blues. Its entrance is
unsigned, but prominent. The other green
option is drift, which is pretty darn
narrow and gets real busy, so I don't
recommend taking it if you can avoid it.
The only true purpose I find for drift
is accessing the town runs if you're
coming from the upper mountain.
Waterfall is pretty mild to start, but
don't be fooled because it develops into
a well-developed mogul field quite
quickly.
The runs served by the Crescent Lift can
be summed up pretty easily as they are
for the most part black mogul runs. They
do rotate grooming through Crescent,
Silver Skis, Silver King, and Willy's
Run, while Shaft and Erica's Gold are
home to the biggest and baddest moguls.
However, those that do get groomed don't
get groomed that often, so they do
develop decent bumps as well. To access
Shaft, you'll need to do a short side
step up, which discourages many people
and makes it my favorite run here. It's
an old lift line, so it's perfectly
straight, albeit fairly narrow. Between
Shaft and Silver King are a bunch of
unnamed cut mogul runs with some solid
tree skiing between them. The easiest
way down this side of the ridge is
Silver Queen. To get to this blue
groomer, the easy way is to head
straight off the lift as if to go to
Bonanza, then make a U-turn to the left
at the yurt. This route, however, is
quite flat. The other way is to start
down Crescent, but this is very steep
and is not intermediate level. Silver
Queen is quite popular and thus can get
mowgled or icy at the end of the day.
Down below Erica's Gold is the Gotacha
cutoff, a winding road that serves as
the best way out of King Khan, so that
you can avoid a major choke point we'll
discuss in part B. There are two
shortcuts on the cutoff, both of which
are typically left ungroomed. And the
only reason women's is a blue, is
because it is a bit mellower than the
rest of the runs on the ridge. To get to
everything below shaft, you'll need to
take this King Kong access trail. To get
here, follow signs that say easy way
down. You can access Silver King and
down from the top of King Kong by
traversing right after you enter the
gate.
To finish off, let's discuss the King
Kong pod. The King Con lift serves all
of its own pod, as well as being the run
out from Thain's Canyon and a reliever
lift for the Miner camp area via
Broadway. Additionally, those who use
Eagle or Silverstar as their initial out
of base will be pushed to King Khan. As
such, the lift can get fairly busy.
However, its lines tend to move faster
than other lifts. There are two ways out
of King Khan. The first is to head to
Silver Load and the second is to ski the
crescent runs we just talked about. If
you have the ability, I would highly,
highly recommend the crescent runs for
reasons we'll discuss in part B.
Now, as you can see, there are just
heaps and heaps of blues here, but
unfortunately, many are left ungroomed
for days at a time and can thus develop
moguls. The only runs groomed nightly
are King Kong, King Kong Ridge, Sikka,
and Temptation. Spyro and Sheamus are
groomed fairly commonly as well. All the
rest here, including the blacks, are
groomed enough not to get huge moguls
like you might find elsewhere, but
aren't necessarily smooth. King Khan and
Sika are the two runs I'll talk about
specifically, as King K is typically the
busiest run here, and also one of the
steepest, so I try to avoid it. Sika is
my favorite run in the pod.
Additionally, just like every other pod
in this part, a low elevation here can
lead to some pretty icy conditions. I'll
add in now that this lower part of the
mountain doesn't have much decent tree
skiing, although we'll discuss all the
spots that do. At the bottom of the pod,
coming from most of the runs, you have
three options. If you keep right, you'll
head down this nice blue groomer, while
the left takes you on a mildly pitched
road around and down. The middle choice
is a very popular one, despite its
nature as a well-developed black mogul
field. This leads to many people
challenging their abilities. So, for
those who ski mogul regularly,
combustion may be one to skip. Up
adjacent to King Kong Ridge is a medium
terrain park that's great to get away
from the hustle and bustle of the three
kings parks.
Down below the King Kong Pod is
Silverstar, which is primarily a real
estate lift. However, the Blue Groomer
in this pod, also called Silverstar, is
a great lap, provided good conditions,
as it hardly ever gets busy, and you can
often ski the whole thing without
encountering another person. Ligy Split
is a standard mogul run, while Vista
starts off as a meadow and then leads
into some mogul and treat areas. The
former is somewhat shielded down in a
goalie, but the ladder gets lots of sun
exposure and is best as an afternoon
lap. The Silverstar lift is a fixed
grip, but doesn't get too bad of lines,
nor is it a super long ride.
All right, that about does it for part
A. Now, go check out parts B, C, and D
all about the rest of Park City. A shout
out to at XPZ for correctly guessing the
mystery run in the night skiing
breakdown. If you want to be shouted out
in a video just like this, keep an eye
out for mystery runs and guess them in
the comments. As always, please put any
questions down below. Thank you all so
much for watching. All my love. I'm out.
