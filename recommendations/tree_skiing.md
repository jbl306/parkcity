# Park City — Tree Skiing Guide

## Best Tree Runs

### Mountain Village Side

| Run | Lift | Location | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| ⬛ **10th Mountain** | Pioneer | Pioneer pod | Best single black tree skiing on Mountain Village side |
| ⬛⬛ **Molly's** ⚠️ | McConkey's | McConkey's | ⚠️ Insanely steep; tighter trees skier's right = less steep + better snow; hidden drops at top |
| ⬛⬛ **Black Forest** | McConkey's | McConkey's | Similar to Molly's but less technical entrance |
| ⬛⬛ **Indicator / Six Bells** ⚠️ | Jupiter | Jupiter pod | ⚠️ Extremely narrow tree-defined chutes; HARDEST lines in all of PC; unsigned; always ski with a partner |
| ⬛⬛ **Portuguese Gap** | Jupiter | Jupiter pod | Wider tree shoot; favorite line in Jupiter; skier's right path preferred |
| ⬛ **Mystic Pines** | Peak 5 | Peak 5 pod | Really good tree skiing; much better than lower mountain options |
| ⬛ **Dividend / Widowmaker trees** | Payday | Payday pod | Solid advanced tree skiing between the two runs when conditions allow |
| 🟦 **Mid Mountain area** | Bonanza | Bonanza pod | Good lower-level tree skiing in and around Mid Mountain trail |
| ⬛⬛ **Blue Slip Bowl (looker's left)** ⚠️ | Pioneer | Pioneer pod | ⚠️ Extremely steep and technical trees with HIDDEN CLIFFS under the lift |
| ⬛⬛ **Pine Cone Ridge** | Hike from Jupiter/Quicksilver | Pine Cone Ridge | Most isolated backcountry-esque terrain at any Vail resort; great variety of trees, gullies, open faces; only open a few weeks per season |
| ⬛⬛ **Moon Runs** | Hike from Jupiter | Pine Cone Ridge | Best places to find powder at PC |

### Canyons Side

| Run | Lift | Location | Notes |
|-----|------|----------|-------|
| ⬛⬛ **Desuites** | Tombstone Express | Tombstone pod | Super underrated; multiple hidden tree shoots in woods; flowy, long, keeps great snow |
| ⬛ **The Aspens** | Saddleback Express | Saddleback pod | Best single black in pod; gorgeous aesthetic cruising through aspens — can't be beat |
| ⬛ **Escapade Woods** | Tombstone Express | Tombstone pod | Nice glade into natural gully; commit to full vertical — can't exit until Tombstone Alley |
| ⬛⬛ **Chimera trees** ⚠️ | Dreamcatcher | Dreamcatcher pod | ⚠️ Expert-only; exceedingly steep — would be double black at most mountains; shaded = great snow |
| ⬛ **Spectre / Fool's Paradise** | Dreamcatcher | Dreamcatcher pod | Several cut lines with solid tree skiing to duck into; watch for thickets at bottom |
| ⬛ **Condor Woods** | Super Condor Express | Super Condor pod | Standard steep glades; flows into Kanes Gully |
| ⬛⬛ **The Abyss (skier's right)** ⚠️ | Peak 5 | Peak 5 pod | ⚠️ Do NOT enter The Abyss without cliff/chute preparation — even the tree skiing side can funnel into gnarly chutes |
| ⬛ **Advanced trees past Snow Meadow** | Dreamscape | Dreamscape pod | Good advanced tree skiing beyond the blue mogul runs |
| ⬛ **Links / Eagle trees** | Orange Bubble Express | OBX pod | Well-shaded side with much better snow than opposing face |

## Trees to Avoid

| Run | Lift | Location | Why |
|-----|------|----------|-----|
| ⬛ **Cobalt Woods / Platinum Woods** | Iron Mountain | Iron Mountain pod | Low elevation = sparse coverage; better trees elsewhere |
| ⬛ **Black Hole** | Orange Bubble Express | OBX/Sun Peak area | Decent skiing but better tree options elsewhere; annoying flat runout |
| ⬛ **Condor Woods** (hard pack days) | Super Condor Express | Super Condor pod | Flows into Kanes Gully which gets narrow/steep — sketchy on hard pack |
| ⬛ **South-facing runs off Condor ridge** | Super Condor Express | Super Condor pod | Face straight south; don't hold snow; only good a few days per season |
| ⬛ **Silver Streak** | Iron Mountain | Iron Mountain pod | Bottom half sun-exposed; closed often, poor coverage |
| ⬛ **Thunder / Lightning** | Tombstone Express | Tombstone pod | Tons of sun; only worth it when conditions are specifically good |
| ⬛ **Tree Time** | — | Lower mountain | Mentioned as inferior to Mystic Pines |
| ⬛ **Silverado Bowl trees** | Orange Bubble Express | OBX pod | Gets absolutely blasted by sun; coverage issues |
| — **Lower mountain PC side generally** | — | Various | The presenter notes the lower part of Mountain Village doesn't have much decent tree skiing overall |
