# Park City — Recommended Lift Paths

## Mountain Village Side

### Morning Start Strategy
- **Skip First Time** — it gets monstrous lines. Head to **Eagle** instead, then pop over to **King Con** or take **Gotcha Cutoff** to the main lifts.
- On busier days, **take a bus into town** and ride **Town Lift** up — often bypasses longer base area lines.
- **Payday** and **Crescent** are the main out-of-base lifts; they get similar lines, so default to Payday unless you want the canyon side quickly (then use Crescent).

### Recommended Flow Up the Mountain
1. **Payday** → **Bonanza Access** (short & flat) → **Bonanza** lift
2. **Bonanza** → fork here:
   - **Right** to Silver Load area — but **avoid Silver Load** if at all possible. Instead take **Carbide Cut** to **Motherload Express** (fraction of the lines).
   - **Left** to Pioneer pod — **most underrated area**, quietest blue cruisers, best lunch at Mid-Mountain Lodge
3. From **Pioneer** → **McConkey's** six-pack for panoramic views and advanced terrain
4. From **McConkey's** → hike to **Jupiter Peak** (5-15 min) or take Jupiter Access trail to **Jupiter Lift** for the best expert terrain on the PC side

### Key Routing Tips
- From **King Con**, take the **Crescent runs** to exit — NOT Silver Load. This avoids a major choke point.
- Use **Gotcha Cutoff** (from below Crescent) as the best escape from King Con back to base.
- **TNT adventure zone** (accessed via Parley's Park) is a hidden gem — super long, usually empty.
- **Thaynes pod** is accessible from Motherload or Single Jack — the fixed grip double isn't as bad as you'd think.
- **Pine Cone Ridge** (hike from Jupiter) is the most isolated terrain at any Vail resort — worth doing once, but only open a few weeks per season.

## Canyons Side

### Morning Start Strategy
- **Orange Bubble Express (OBX)** is the best base lift choice — lines move faster and are ~5 min shorter than Red Pine Gondola.
- **Sunrise Gondola** (new, tucked away) will likely have the shortest lines of all three.
- All three base lifts empty out by ~11:30, so don't stress if you're a late starter.

### Recommended Flow Up the Mountain
1. **OBX** → top out at **Lookout Cabin** area
   - Lap **Lookout Ridge** (favorite groomer in all of PC) or head to **Super Condor**
   - Take **Arrowhead** via OBX + Lookout for fastest access to Condor
2. **Super Condor** → lap **Apex Ridge** (one of longest blues anywhere) or **Kanes Gully** / **Devil's Friend** for expert moguls
   - Don't lap Condor in spurts — do it all at once because exits (Easy Street / Willow Draw) are painfully flat
3. To reach southern terrain: **Tombstone** is the gateway but a major choke point. Alternative route: **Timberline → Iron Mountain** to bypass Tombstone lines
4. From **Tombstone** → **Peak 5** → **Dreamscape** area
   - **Daybreak** is the most underrated lift — quietest blues in all of Canyons
   - **Dreamscape** has the best blue mogul runs at PC (especially **Bliss**, which is somewhat hidden)
   - **Dreamcatcher** has fantastic terrain but a brutal 15+ min ride
5. For experts: **9990** for **94 Turns** (must-hit VW-sized moguls) and **Peak 5** for **The Abyss** (gnarliest terrain at PC)

### Key Routing Tips
- **Avoid Chicane** at all costs — worst run on canyon side; feels like skiing a highway. Use Sidewinder or Cloud 9 instead for lapping Tombstone.
- **Another World** is immensely popular — hit it first thing in the morning or skip it for **Tranquility** (more enjoyable, less crowded).
- To get back to base: **ride a gondola down** if beginner/low-intermediate. Otherwise take **Over and Out** from Tombstone bottom — better than Willow Draw.
- **Quicksilver Gondola** (PC ↔ Canyons): on weekends, pick ONE side for the whole day. If you must cross, fastest route is base lifts → Timberline → Iron Mountain → Quicksilver.
- **Mimi's Way** off Blaze's Way is a trap — it dead-ends at the wrong side of Flat Iron with no signs warning you.
