# Park City Mountain — Insider's Guide

> **[Live Site →](https://jbl306.github.io/parkcity/)** — Mobile-first web app for on-mountain reference

Notes and recommendations compiled from the 4-part [Insider's Guide to Park City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggtElWFhwi4) YouTube series.

## Web App

A lightweight, mobile-first web UI for quick on-mountain reference. No framework, no build step — pure HTML/CSS/JS.

- **Dark/Light mode** — auto-switches based on system preference
- **Search** — find any trail, lift, or route across all tabs
- **Difficulty filter** — filter by green/blue/black/double-black
- **5 tabs**: Trails, Routes, Strategy, Trees, Maps

Deploy: Enable GitHub Pages → Settings → Pages → Source: branch `main`, folder `/site`

- [Turn-by-Turn Directions](recommendations/turn_by_turn_directions.md) — Google Maps-style step-by-step route instructions for recommended flows
- [Recommended Lift Paths](recommendations/lift_paths.md) — Optimal routes up the mountain for both Mountain Village and Canyons sides, crowd avoidance strategies, and morning start tips
- [Tree Skiing Guide](recommendations/tree_skiing.md) — Best tree runs and ones to avoid, organized by lift with difficulty ratings
- [Lift Navigation Graphs](recommendations/lift_navigation_graphs.md) — Visual flowcharts showing how lifts connect, recommended paths, and cross-mountain routes

## Methodology

All recommendations are sourced from the 4-part [Insider's Guide to Park City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggtElWFhwi4) YouTube series. Transcripts were auto-downloaded using `yt-dlp`, cleaned of subtitle duplicates, and analyzed to extract trail descriptions, crowd patterns, lift strategies, and terrain warnings. No first-hand skiing experience or external sources were used — everything reflects the opinions and routing advice from the video creator.
